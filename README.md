OpenAL Project


In this project, I'm loading audio using the NAudio library and sending it to the OpenAL API. It can be used for games, but it can also be utilized for music playback. It's not a very complex project, as I'm still learning about audio and the OpenAL API. As I study these topics, I will be implementing new features, including a way to stream audio for music. I hope this helps you.
